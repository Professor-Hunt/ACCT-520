The process is iterative. Almost never do you get everything right the first time. As you work through the business understanding process and move to the data understanding process you may find that you cannot find the data you need and you may have to reformulate your question. The other side of the coin can also be true, perhaps you have access to better data than expected and you can answer more detailed questions etc. The process may go back and forth many times. The same is true for the analysis/modeling phase. There can be more than one and often many analysis/modeling techniques that can answer your questions. Each technique may require different data preparation. The model may or may not perform well or accomplish the business object and that would require us to start the process over. If the model accomplishes the business objective, then it is time to deploy it.\n\nBusiness Understanding\nData Understanding\nData Preparation\nModeling\nEvaluation\nDeployment"

    "text": "This course will attempt to focus on data fallacies. A data fallacy is defined as data used incorrectly to draw insights. Data fallacies and logical fallacies are intimately related and often one in the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Fallacy Sources\n\n\nData fallacies are the result of ignorance, error, or fraud. Fraud is the easiest to ascribe after it is discovered. Accountants often refer to the fraud triangle: Opportunity, Incentive, and Rationalization. Ignorance and error are harder to nail down, but we will discuss all three possibilities. Fraud is perhaps the worst source of a data fallacy followed close behind by ignorance. The least egregious is error and hopefully it is the most common source of data fallacies, but I am not so sure these days. Considering the source of a data fallacy is important, but spotting the fallacy is more important. Of the three sources fraud and ignorance might cause you to be more skeptical of data that is presented if you can pick up on either of these. Unfortunately data outputs are often reports or dashboards or models and you may not be able to interact directly with the data analyst that created the output. Errors would be impossible to glean from speaking with the analyst because by definition the analyst does not know a mistake was made.Incorrect data analyses do not always lead to incorrect conclusions, but it is better to be sure than to be lucky. Luck can run out.\nWe cannot discuss data fallacies without understanding the stages in a data science project. The course will be organized by these stages and within each stage we will talk about each stage, do labs, and projects related to that stage. I will attempt to include the most common fallacies associated within each stage, but these fallacies can span multiple stages.. This is not a exhaustive dive into all fallacies, but it should make you aware of the most common data errors and logical errors associated with data analytics."
