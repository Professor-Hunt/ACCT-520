# Accounting Analytics for Managers

This course will attempt to focus on data fallacies. A data fallacy is defined as an error used to draw insights from data. Data fallacies and logical fallacies are intimately related and often one in the same. I purposefully defined it as a error because for this class it does not matter if the error is made intentionally or out of ignorance. The result is the same...the insight generated needs to be investigated further. Errors do not always lead to incorrect conclusions, but it is better to be sure, than to be lucky. Luck can run out.

Unfortunately we cannot discuss data fallacies without understanding the stages in a data science project. The course will be organized by these stages and within each stage we will talk about each stage, do labs, and projects related to that stage. I will attempt to include the most common fallacies associated within each stage, but these fallacies can span multiple stages.. This is not a exhaustive dive into all fallacies, but it should make you aware of the most common data errors and logical errors associated with data analytics.

# CRISP-DM

The **CR**oss **I**ndustry **S**tandard **P**rocess for **D**ata **M**ining ([*CRISP-DM*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)) is a process model that serves as the base for a data science project. This is not the only characterization of the data science process, but most are very similar.

1.  Business Understanding

2.  Data Understanding

3.  Data Preparation

4.  Modeling

5.  Evaluation

6.  Deployment

Within the CRISP-DM structure there are areas that data fallacies will be more prevalent. Phases 2-5 are the data intensive parts and thus are subject to data fallacies. We will briefly discuss 1 and 6, which are arguably the most important phases. But this course will focus on common data fallacies, some logical fallacies, and some cognitive biases. The hope is that you will understand the basics of a data analytics project and that you will be able to recognize problems within a project. Ignorance is never an acceptable excuse, but we do not know what we do not know.
